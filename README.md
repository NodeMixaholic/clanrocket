ClanRocket stems off of the clanvert source tree (completely made by me as time of writing) and makes it open source. to be specific it is an automatic moderation and xp bot.

to be clear, all clanvert code is stripped out (which was only naming).

Note that I was under no contract/obligation to keep it closed-source. Thus, I could have taken my changes (which were ALL of them) and opened them.
