# ClanRocket
ClanRocket stems off of the clanvert source tree (completely made by me as time of writing) and makes it open source. to be specific it is an automatic moderation and xp bot.

to be clear, all clanvert code is stripped out (which was only naming).

## For any clanvert moderators out there...

 you can blame Nonameperson for Clanrocket, as he is the reason this project exists. Because he was toxic to me, and he was an owner of clanvert which the main owner didn't kick or ban. (I was Head Progammer at the time, as well as the only one ever maintaining the project) Clanrocket is proud protestware.
